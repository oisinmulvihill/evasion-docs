Introduction
=============

The "evasion.messger" is the communication library used as part of the hardware abstraction 
process. A Publish/Subscribe system is implemented on top of the STOMP_ protocol. This allows
communication across processes, programs and even machines distributed across a network. The 
Publish/Subscribe system uses pydispatcher_ at its heart.
