Development Set up
------------------

MacOSX
~~~~~~

From the project root you need to run "viewpoint_mac_devsetup.sh". This creates a the absolute path
symlink from the "viewpoint" to "Resources" inside the "platform/macosx/viewpoint.app/Contents"
To release the project the contents of the viewpoint resources could be copied instead. 

Windows
~~~~~~~

I'm not sure yet how to get this to work as symlinks don't work here...
